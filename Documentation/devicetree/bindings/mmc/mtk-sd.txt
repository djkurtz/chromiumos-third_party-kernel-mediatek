* MTK MMC controller

The MTK  MSDC can act as a MMC controller
to support MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the msdc driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,mmc".
- interrupts: Should contain MSDC interrupt number
- core-power-supply: power to the Core
- io-power-supply: power to the IO
- clocks: MSDC source clock, PLL clock
- clock-names: src_clk, pll_clk

Examples:

mmc0@11230000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mmc";
	reg = <0 0x11230000 0 0x108>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 39 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	core-power-supply = <&mt6397_vemc_3v3_reg>;
	io-power-supply = <&mt6397_vio18_reg>;
	clocks = <&msdc20_1_ck>, <&msdcpll>;
	clock-names = "src_clk", "pll_clk";
};
